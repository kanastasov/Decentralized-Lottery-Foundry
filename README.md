# Decentralized-Lottery-Foundry

A lottery system which allows people to enter in lottery with some entrance fees and a random winner will be selected on the basis of vrfCoordinator by chainlink at regular time interval. It is fully decentralized and thus removes all the fraudulent scenarios, making it more efficient.

Below is the link for the front-end by which you can interact with the smart contract (Imp: You need a metamask wallet as a browser extension)
